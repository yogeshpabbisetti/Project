  <h3>Ways to improve soft skills : </h3>
    There are many benefits to improving your soft skills, including relationship building with coworkers and career development. Here are 11 steps to improve your soft skills:</br>
    1.	Be open to feedback.</br>
    2.	Communicate often.</br>
    3.	Emphasize teamwork.</br>
    4.	Build positive relationships.</br>
    5.	Step outside of your comfort zone.</br>
    6.	Get ready to learn.</br>
    7.	Adapt to workplace changes.</br>
    8.	Observe others.</br>
    9.	Work through conflict.</br>
    10.	Take on a leadership role.</br>
    11.	Arrive to work on time.</br>
    Be open to feedback</br>
    A large part of improving your soft skills is being open to feedback you may receive from supervisors, managers and even coworkers. When you're open to feedback, you can be better able to receive constructive criticism and use that information to improve in your workplace role, including your soft skills. You may receive feedback on your communication skills, ability to work in a group, time management, leadership potential and more.
    As you're receiving feedback, consider thanking the individual who's providing it and developing a plan, either with yourself or through speaking with a manager, to improve and learn.</br>
    <h5> Communicate often</h5>
    Effective communication is a soft skill that benefits everyone in the workplace. Although you may have tasks and responsibilities that don't require the help of anyone else in your office, take the opportunities you have to form relationships with those around you. Communicate often to develop this soft skill. This includes communication face-to-face, through email and in presentations to a group. Since nearly every method of communication differs from another, it's important to communicate through various means so your communication soft skills are more well-rounded.
    When you communicate, think about how you're addressing others, how clear your message is, your body language and your tone of voice. You'll also be able to see how others communicate and take tips and techniques from them to find a communication style that works for you.</br>
    <h5>Emphasize teamwork</h5>
    When you engage in good teamwork, you show your employer that you are great at collaborating with others. Teamwork could occur in a group setting for a presentation or one-on-one with another coworker to complete a shared task. During a shared task or daily responsibility, allow each member of the group to contribute their share and celebrate the different skills and personalities of the group. When you emphasize teamwork, you open yourself up to learning opportunities from your coworkers while improving your own skills.</br>
    <h5>Build positive relationships</h5>
    A lot of the soft skills you use in the workplace rely on the relationship you have with other employees and managers. You can build positive relationships with your coworkers by engaging in a genuine conversation about their weekend plans, family, hobbies and interests. Try to find ways to connect with them over a shared experience. If you work in a department with multiple people, consider asking everyone if they would be interested in going out for a group lunch on Friday.
    Stepping away from the office is a nice way to be able to connect with them on a personal level. This may assist you professionally because you'll know their personality a bit more and have the ability to understand how it factors into their work ethic.</br>

  <h2>Team Managment</h2>
  <button><i class="fas fa-plus"></i></button>
  <button><i class="fas fa-minus"></i></button>
  <div class="cnt">
  <h3>First Things First</h3>
<p>But before that, some definitions are useful. What is management, exactly? And how does it differ from leadership?
A good starting point is the Warren G. Bennis quote that "Leaders are people who do the right things; managers are people who do things right." Leadership involves creating a compelling vision of the future, communicating that vision, and helping people understand and commit to it. Managers, on the other hand, are responsible for ensuring that the vision is implemented efficiently and successfully.
Of course, these two roles overlap – and, to be fully effective, you need to fulfill both roles. However, the focus of this article is on the specific skills and responsibilities of managers, and on the tools available to them. After all, there's no point energizing people to work towards a fabulous vision of the future, only to fall flat on your face when it comes to implementation.</p>

<h4>The Importance of Delegation</h4>
<p>The top priority for team managers is delegation . No matter how skilled you are, there's only so much that you can achieve working on your own. With a team behind you, you can achieve so much more: that's why it's so important that you delegate effectively!
Successful delegation starts with matching people and tasks, so you first need to explain what your team's role and goals are. A good way of doing this is to put together a team charter , which sets out the purpose of the team and how it will work. Not only does this help you get your team off to a great start, it can also be useful for bringing the team back on track if it's veering off course.
Only then will you be in a position to think about the skills, experience and competencies within your team, and start matching people to tasks. Read our article on task allocation  for more on how to do this, and to find out how to deal with real-world challenges, such as managing the gaps between team members' skill sets.</p>

<h4>Motivating Your Team</h4>
<p>Another key duty you have as a manager is to motivate team members.
Our article on Theory X and Theory Y  explains two very different approaches to motivation, which depend on the fundamental assumptions that you make about the people who work for you. If you believe that they're intrinsically lazy, you believe in Theory X, while if you believe that most are happy and willing to work, you'll tend towards Theory Y. Make sure that you fully understand these theories – they will fundamentally affect your success in motivating people.</p>
<h4>Developing Your Team</h4>
<p>Teams are made up of individuals who have different outlooks and abilities, and are at different stages of their careers. Some may find that the tasks you've allocated to them are challenging, and they may need support. Others may be "old hands" at what they're doing, and may be looking for opportunities to stretch their skills. Either way, it's your responsibility to develop all of your people.
Your skills in this aspect of management will define your long-term success as a manager. If you can help team members to become better at what they do, you'll be a manager who people aspire to work for, and you'll make a great contribution to your organization, too.
The most effective way of developing your people is to ensure that you give regular feedback  to members of your team. Many of us are nervous of giving feedback, especially when it has to be negative. However, if you give and receive feedback regularly, everyone's performance will improve.
Beyond this, our article on Understanding Developmental Needs  will help you develop individual team members, so that they can perform at their best.</p>

<h4>Communicating and Working With Your Team – and With Others</h4>
<p>Communication skills are essential for success in almost any role, but there are particular skills and techniques that you'll use more as a manager than you did as a regular worker. These fall under two headings: communicating with team members, and communicating with people outside your team. We'll look at each in turn.</p>

<h4>Communicating With People in Your Team</h4>
<p>As a team manager, you're likely to be chairing regular sessions as well as one-off meetings. Meeting of all kinds, and regular ones in particular, are notorious for wasting people's time, so it's well worth mastering the skill of running effective meetings .
Many meetings include brainstorming  sessions. As a team manager, you'll often have to facilitate  these, so you'll need to be comfortable with doing this. There's more to this than simply coming up with creative ideas, as you do when you're just a regular participant in such a session: read our article  to find out how to run brainstorming sessions. Make sure that you understand where they can go wrong, and what you can do to avoid this.
Active listening  is another important skill for managers – and others – to master. When you're in charge, it can be easy to think that you know what others are going to say, or that listening is less important, because you've thought of a solution anyway.
Don't fall into this trap. Most good managers are active listeners: it helps them detect problems early (while they're still easy to deal with), avoid costly misunderstandings, and build trust within their teams.</p>

<h4>Communicating With People Outside Your Team</h4>
<p>Your boss is probably the most important person you need to communicate with. Take time to understand fully what your boss wants from you and your team – if you know exactly what she likes, and how she prefers this to be delivered, you'll be better able to meet with her approval.
Don't be afraid to ask your boss to coach or mentor you: you can usually learn a lot from him, but he may not be proactive about offering this. If you're approaching your boss for advice, make sure that you've thought things through as far as you can. Introduce the subject with a summary of your thinking, and then say where you need help.
Also, as a manager, part of your job is to look after your team and protect it from unreasonable pressure. Learn skills like assertiveness  and win-win negotiation , so that you can either turn work away, or negotiate additional resources.
Another part of your job is to manage the way that your team interacts with other groups. Use stakeholder analysis  to identify the groups that you need to deal with. Then talk to these people to find out what they want from you, and what they can do to help you.</p>

<h4>Managing Discipline</h4>
<p>However much you hope that you won't have to do it, there comes a time in most managers' careers when they have to discipline an employee. Discipline may be subtly different from basic feedback, because it doesn't always relate specifically to the employee's work. You can give feedback on their phone manner, for example, but handling problems with timekeeping or personal grooming can need a different approach.
Obvious breaches of the law or of company policy are easy to identify and deal with. But what of other situations? On one hand, you don't want to seem petty. On the other hand, you can't let things go that should be dealt with.</p>

<div id="prblmslv">
  <h2>Problem solving</h2>
  <button><i class="fas fa-plus"></i></button>
  <button><i class="fas fa-minus"></i></button>
  <div class="cnt">
  <p>Problem-solving skills help you solve issues quickly and effectively. It's one of the key skills that employers seek in job applicants, as employees with these skills tend to be self-reliant. Problem-solving skills require quickly identifying the underlying issue and implementing a solution.
Problem-solving is considered a soft skill (a personal strength) rather than a hard skill that's learned through education or training. You can improve your problem-solving skills by familiarizing yourself with common issues in your industry and learning from more experienced employees.</p>
<h4>How Problem-Solving Skills Work</h4>
<p>Problem-solving starts with identifying the issue. For example, a teacher might need to figure out how to improve student performance on a writing proficiency test. To do that, the teacher will review the writing tests looking for areas of improvement. They might see that students can construct simple sentences, but they're struggling with writing paragraphs and organizing those paragraphs into an essay.
To solve the problem, the teacher would work with students on how and when to write compound sentences, how to write paragraphs, and ways to organize an essay.
There are five steps typically used in problem-solving.</p>
<h4>1. Analyze Contributing Factors</h4>
<p>To solve a problem, you must find out what caused it. This requires you to gather and evaluate data, isolate possible contributing circumstances, and pinpoint what needs to be addressed for a resolution.</p>
<h4>To do this, you'll use skills like:</h4>
	<ul><li>Data gathering</li>
	<li>Data analysis</li>
	<li>Fact-finding</li>
	<li>Historical analysis</li></ul>
<h4>2. Generate Interventions</h4>
<p>Once you’ve determined the cause, brainstorm possible solutions. Sometimes this involves teamwork since two (or more) minds are often better than one. A single strategy is rarely the obvious route to solving a complex problem; devising a set of alternatives helps you cover your bases and reduces your risk of exposure should the first strategy you implement fail.</p>
<ul>This involves skills like:
	<li>Brainstorming</li>
	<li>Creative thinking</li>
	<li>Prediction</li>
	<li>Forecasting</li>
	<li>Project design</li>
	<li>Project planning</li>
  </ul>
<h4>3. Evaluate Solutions</h4>
<p>Depending on the nature of the problem and your chain of command, evaluating best solutions may be performed by assigned teams, team leads, or forwarded to corporate decision-makers. Whoever makes the decision must evaluate potential costs, 
  required resources, and possible barriers to successful solution implementation.</p>
<ul>This requires several skills, including:
	<li>Analysis</li>
	<li>Discussion</li>
	<li>Corroboration</li>
	<li>Teamwork</li>
	<li>Test development</li>
	<li>Mediation</li>
	<li>Prioritizing</li>
  </ul>
<h4>4. Implement a Plan</h4>
<p>Once a course of action has been decided, it must be implemented along with benchmarks that can quickly and accurately determine whether it’s working. Plan implementation also involves letting personnel know about changes in standard operating procedures.</p>
<ul>This requires skills like:
	<li>Project management</li>
	<li>Project implementation</li>
	<li>Collaboration</li>
	<li>Time management</li>
	<li>Benchmark development</li>
  </ul>
<h4>5. Assess the Solution's Effectiveness</h4>
<p>Once a solution is implemented, the best problem-solvers have systems in place to evaluate if and how quickly it's working. This way, they know as soon as possible whether the issue has been resolved or whether they’ll have to change their response to the problem mid-stream.</p>
<ul>This requires:
  <li>Communication</li>
	<li>Data analysis</li>
	<li>Surveys</li>
	<li>Customer feedback</li>
	<li>Follow-through</li>
	<li>Troubleshooting</li>

  <h2>Intrapersonal Skills</h2>
  <button><i class="fas fa-plus"></i></button>
  <button><i class="fas fa-minus"></i></button>
  <div class="cnt">
  <h4>How to Build Intrapersonal Skills</h4>
<p>What they are</br>
While you may not spend a lot of time considering your intrapersonal skills, they come into play pretty regularly. In fact, you probably use these skills in most areas of your life.</p>
<ul>These skills, which relate to emotional intelligence, include things like:
<li>●	self-confidence</li>
<li>●	resilience</li>
<li>●	self-discipline</li>
<li>●	persistence</li>
<li>●	openness to new ideas</li>
<li>●	the ability to overcome distractions</li>
<li>●	time management</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why they’re important</h4>
<p>You may have noticed these skills all have something to do with your ability to self-regulate.</br>
  People with strong self-regulation abilities often have an easier time:</p>
●	managing behavior and emotions</br>
●	weathering challenges</br>
●	working toward goals in spite of distractions</br>
<p>Unlike interpersonal skills like active listening, intrapersonal skills may have less of an immediate impact on your interactions with others. But they’re still essential.
Don’t worry if these skills don’t come to you naturally. It’s absolutely possible to cultivate intrapersonal intelligence. The 10 tips below can help.
Make (and keep) a schedule</p>
<p>Do responsibilities and to-do lists overwhelm you?</p>
<p>Maybe you frequently forget about commitments or let chores you dislike pile up because you never feel like doing them.</p>
<p>It’s hard to get started when you have no idea where to begin. You keep putting things off, but of course that leaves you with less time to handle all those (potentially unpleasant) tasks.
If you tend to stray off task when you have a lot to do, try creating a schedule that includes work commitments and appointments along with social activities, household chores, and self-care, like exercise and relaxation.</p>
<h4>This can help because:</h4>
<p>●	having reminders of everything you need to complete can help keep you on track despite distractions</p>
<p>●	scheduling enjoyable activities reminds you there’s more to look forward to than that mountain of laundry</p>
<p>After a few weeks, you might notice a change in how you manage your time— even without the help of a schedule.</br>
Redirect your natural talents</br>
Very few people are naturally good at everything, and that’s OK! But you probably have some specific strengths, even if you don’t recognize them yet.</br>
Maybe you have a knack for patience with small children or rude co-workers, but you’re less patient with yourself when you make mistakes.</br>
Or perhaps you’re a fantastic problem-solver at work but have a hard time addressing difficulties in your personal life.</br>
It’s common to direct emotional skills outward in ways that benefit others and fail to apply those same skills to your own experiences.</br>
This can make it seem like you lack those skills, when really you just find it easier to help other people. But you deserve that same support.</br>
If you’d encourage a friend to stick with something challenging, for example, direct that persistence toward yourself instead of giving up.</p>
